This is a game created by me. Steal it if you want, not like you'll get much for it.

You need all the files and folders locations here except for the SaveGames folder sense its not active yet
and the Settings W.I.P files is also just a txt file holding future additions to the settings.json file.
.idea is also useless for getting the project to work. 

This was built with Python 3.8 using the Pycharm IDE. Python 3.8 is needed to get this working most likely.

Still Working on this as of February 2 2021, just slow because of University
