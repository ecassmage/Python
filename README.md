# Python
I Run Python With Python 3.8, if any other python version is used I can not guarantee that any program I write will work
This is also all run out of the Pycharm IDE
Some programs use a 'custom' module set of functions I made without it they will not work.


The AI games has some of the more complex programs I have written
Ai_Project is a project that applies a bit more complexity to the ai evolution program found in ai games evolution_redo. There are many files needed to run it located in there
