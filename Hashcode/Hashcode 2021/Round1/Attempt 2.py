""" Well That red herring almost got me, seriously you don't even need the cars unless you want to max your points as
high as possible First step is to find which roads end at an intersection, then mark, best way is to use a list.
Then you go a start writing the submission file by first writing the length of nodes in the program then looping
through all the nodes by first writing the number of the intersection then writing the number of roads which end at
this intersection and finally looping through all the roads which end at this intersection writing their names down as
you go along. Each road is followed by a number between 1 and the max time in the simulation, but in this case it is
best to just write 1.
So the stuff should be written like this

100  -> This number states that there are 100 intersections that will be written in this file.
0  -> This number means that we will be talking about intersection 0 for now.
2  -> This number means that there are 2 roads which will be given at least 1 second of green light.
Road 1  -> This number means that the roads name is Road and that it will have a green light for 1 second before
            next road goes green
Roadeo 1  -> This number means that the roads name is Roadeo and that it will have a green light for 1 second
            before next road goes green
    // As a side note: if only 1 road is named it should be given 1 and this light will always be green.
1  -> This number means that we are on to the next intersection and the pattern will continue along.

This is the basic attempt, my next attempt involved removing all roads which didn't receive any cars from the system
alleviating some time to the roads which did receive cars overall making the whole system more efficient ever so
slightly. I tried setting better times for the roads based on how many cars used them but it never seemed to pan out
more the maybe a thousand points. Also any intersection which ended up with zero roads ending on it were deactivated
and ignored by the program.

This program has all the files sorted into 2 folders inputFiles folder and outputFiles folder, with the program sitting
outside of these 2 folders.
