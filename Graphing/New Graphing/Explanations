Why do I use a bunch of functions getting parameters likes this (company=None, maxPrice=None) etc
Well I could just send it all up like 99% of the time I will need to send company up but if I do and just use its
magic then I would box myself in to looking towards a future turn or would have to store the old values. This is better
since I can choose the values to send through if need be and if I don't company can just write the value I need into
the corresponding spot. The entire process takes up line space and also takes a few ticks more per call but in my
opinion the loss of speed and use of more space is completely overshadowed by the increased versatility of the function
being able to work this way.
