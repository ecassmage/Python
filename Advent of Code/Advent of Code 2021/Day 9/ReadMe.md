# Advent of Code Day 9
### Parts 1 and 2

This is separated into Part 1 and 2, though there is a Day 9.py, this was my original solution, however
I got annoyed by reading the question wrong so I decided to write a new slightly cleaner version of the program.
(it isn't really cleaner however I did write an object which can deal with future height maps given in a similar format
to this one.)
